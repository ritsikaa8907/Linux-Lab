# Objective: Automate file management.

backup.sh script
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Create backup directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p backup

# Get current timestamp (YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS format)
timestamp=$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")

# Find all .txt files in the current folder
for file in *.txt; do
    if [ -f "$file" ]; then
        # Extract filename without extension
        base=$(basename "$file" .txt)
        # Copy to backup/ with timestamp
        cp "$file" "backup/${base}_${timestamp}.txt"
        echo "Backed up $file â†’ backup/${base}_${timestamp}.txt"
    fi
done

# LAB4 â€“ Backup Script

## ðŸŽ¯ Script Name
`backup.sh`

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose
The script finds all `.txt` files in the current folder and copies them into a `backup/` directory with a timestamp added to the filename.  
This ensures that no backups overwrite each other.

---

##  How the Script Works
1. `mkdir -p backup` â†’ Creates a folder called `backup` if it doesnâ€™t already exist.  
2. `timestamp=$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")` â†’ Stores the current date and time.  
   Example: `20250910_231530`  
3. The script loops over all `.txt` files in the current folder:
   - `basename "$file" .txt` â†’ Gets the filename without extension.  
   - `cp "$file" "backup/${base}_${timestamp}.txt"` â†’ Copies the file into `backup/`, appending the timestamp.  
4. Prints confirmation of each backup created.

---

## â–¶ Example Run

### Step 1: Create some `.txt` files
```bash
echo "Hello World" > notes.txt
echo "Shopping List" > list.txt
```

### Step 2: Run the script
```bash
./backup.sh
```
Output
Backed up notes.txt â†’ backup/notes_20250910_231530.txt
Backed up list.txt â†’ backup/list_20250910_231530.txt
### Step 3: Check backup folder
```bash
ls backup/
```
Result:
```bash
notes_20250910_231530.txt
list_20250910_231530.txt
```

# Extra Questions
What is the difference between cp, mv, and rsync?
1. cp (copy)
Copies files or directories from one place to another.
Original file remains; a duplicate is created.
2. mv (move/rename)
Moves files/directories (like cut-paste).
Removes them from the original location.
Also used for renaming.
3. rsync (remote sync / robust sync)
A powerful tool for copying/synchronizing files.
Works locally and over a network/SSH.
Faster than cp because it only copies changes (not the entire file every time).
Supports progress display, compression, mirroring directories, etc.

How can you schedule scripts to run automatically?
1. Using cron (Linux scheduler)
cron runs tasks at fixed times/dates.
2. Using at (one-time scheduling)
Runs a command/script once at a given time.
3. Using systemd timers (modern Linux)
Alternative to cron.
More powerful for recurring jobs.
Uses .service and .timer files.
